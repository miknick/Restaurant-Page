    `Angel food cake, or 
    angel cake, is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites, flour, and sugar. A whipping agent, 
    such as cream of tartar, is commonly added. It differs from other cakes because it uses no 
    butter. Its aerated texture comes from whipped egg white. Angel food cake originated in the
     United States and first became popular in the late 19th century. It gained

     its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture.`)

  createCard("Battenberg", "./Images/battenbergCake.jpg",
    `Battenberg or Battenburg is a light
     sponge cake held together with jam. 
    The cake is covered in marzipan and, when cut in cross section, displays a distinctive 
    two-by-two check pattern alternately coloured pink and yellow. 
    Charles Nevin wrote in The Independent: “Battenberg cake is exemplarily British. The first 
    cake was baked in 1884 to celebrate Prince Louis of Battenberg marrying Princess Victoria, 
    Queen Victoria’s granddaughter and Prince Philip’s grandmother.” Food historian Ivan Day 
    refuted the royal connection, and states the simplification of the four-panelled cake occurred when “large industrial bakers such as Lyons” got in on the battenberg game – “I suppose a four-panel 
    battenburg [a common 19th-century spelling] is much easier to make on a production line”. `)
  createCard("Cheesecake", "./Images/cheeseCake.jpg",
    `Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting 
    of one or more layers. The main, 
    and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or 
        ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it often consists of a crust or 
        base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), 
    graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. It may be baked or unbaked 
    (usually refrigerated).

    Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in many different ways. 
    It may be flavored by adding vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors 
    to the cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the 
    finished pie with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or 
    other toppings. `)
